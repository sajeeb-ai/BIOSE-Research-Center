## ECG-Based Outcome Prediction for Cardiac Arrest Patients Using 1D-CNN and Wavelet Transform

I built a machine learning system to predict whether patients would have a good or poor outcome after a cardiac arrest, using ECG data from the I-CARE database on PhysioNet. Starting with one-hour ECG recordings and clinical outcome data for 99 patients, I processed the raw signals to make them suitable for analysis. This involved cleaning the data by resampling it to 45 Hz, using median filtering to remove noise, and applying a Butterworth low-pass filter to smooth the signals. To capture meaningful patterns, I used Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) with Morlet wavelets to extract time-frequency features, specifically the mean and variance of the coefficients. I then broke the ECG data into 30-second chunks with 5-second overlaps, creating a robust dataset of 22,566 training and 5,642 validation samples. I designed a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) from scratch to classify outcomes based on these features. After training, the model hit a validation accuracy with solid precision, recall, and f-1 score for both outcome classes, as shown in a detailed classification report.
